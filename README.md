# ErrorNot

A service to be sure that all errors in your apps are raised. You can push errors by POST request
and then do their follow up (pending, resolved, etc) in the app.

 - Info and screenshots are available on the [AF83 dev blog](http://dev.af83.com/git/launch-errornot-english-version/2010/03/24).
 - [Here is a demo site to preview and send your own errors to](http://demo.errornot.af83.com/).

 - On IRC: FreeNode / #errornot
 - Mailing list: errornot@googlegroups.com, http://groups.google.com/group/errornot

## Features

ErrorNot :

* Is multi-project and multi-user (read / comment / edit follow-up)
* Allows you to set a status to the error (pending, etc)
* Allows you to comment the errors
* Notifies you by email every time a new error is raised
* Supports notification via a digest. The frequency of notification is set by a cron

## Upgrading

If you upgrade your errornot, you need launch the task to migration your database if needed

  `rake db:mongo_migrate`

## Using

  Depending of what is more convenient to your project, you can use one of the ErrorNot notifiers to send errors to ErrorNot:

   - The [Ruby errornot notifier (Rails, Sinatra, Rack)](http://github.com/shingara/errornot_notifier)
   - The [PHP errornot notifier](http://github.com/francois2metz/php-errornot)
   - The [Drupal notifier](http://drupal.org/project/errornot)
   - The [Python errornot notifier](http://bitbucket.org/virtuo/errornot_notifier_py/wiki/Home) with support for WSGI applications (Django, Pylons...)

## Development

If you want to hack ErrorNot, you need launch all Test. This test is made with rspec.

You can install all gems needed with command :

 - `bundle`

Now you can launch spec :

 - `rake spec`

If you want to fill your Database with a lot of fake data, you can launch the task :

 - `rake db:populate:default`

This task depends of :

 - `rake db:populate:users`
 - `rake db:populate:projects`
 - `rake db:populate:errors`
 - `rake db:populate:comments`
 - `rake db:populate:same_errors`

When you have generated some data, you can fetch a user account by console and use the
default password 'tintinpouet'

    $ rails c
    > Project.first.members.first.email
    => "pinguidity@yachtdom.com"

Every project has one related email. You can use this email to log in.
